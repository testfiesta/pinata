## About

**BETA** - _Pinata is just getting started - please report any and all bugs you find. Likewise, contributions to the code to fix issues are always appreciated!_

Pinata exists to help make tester's lives easier. Ideally, it should remove friction from the exploratory process - everywhere from gathering evidence to submitting reports.

Our view is that testing is an art as varied and complex as those who undertake it. So our goal is to create a flexible, extensible toolset to raise the bar for what each member of the testing community can accomplish.

If you have an idea about how we can better meet that goal, please let us know by [requesting a feature](https://github.com/dacoaster/pinata/labels/enhancement) or, better yet, [put in a pull request!](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

If you looking to contribute - please checkout the [contributing guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you're just looking to take it for a spin, check out the pre-built [packages](https://testfiesta.com/downloads) and find the one built for your platform. Can't find the platform you're looking for? Let us know you'd like a new one supported by submitting a [feature requests](https://github.com/dacoaster/pinata/labels/enhancement)!

### Installation

TODO - This section could use some love (and screenshots!)

### MacOS settings to allow screen recording and screenshots

To allow Pinata taking screenshots and record your screen please make sure you allowed the app to do that by doing next steps:

- Choose Apple menu > System Settings, then click Privacy & Security in the sidebar. (You may need to scroll down.)
- Click Screen Recording on the right. Turn screen recording on for Pinata

  \*We are working on the solution to make screenshots work also on a dev build. This manual will be updated as soon we will have a solution

## Usage
